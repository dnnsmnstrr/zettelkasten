# Makerspace

As a huge fan of makerspaces, I was really excited to find out that the [Offene Werkstatt](https://offenewerkstattmainz.de/) was opening in Mainz. 

I had previously been to the [Maker Space](https://maker-space.de/) in Garching and also visited their newer branch in Munich at the Circular Hackfest, where I won a membership to the Maker Space for a year.
