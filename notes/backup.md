# Backup
I don't worry much about losing files, because most of my data is stored in multiple cloud services, as well as on local hard drives.

My Goal is to apply the **3-2-1** strategy:

```
3 Copies of all my data
2 Copies on different storage media (e.g. HDD, SSD, Cloud)
1 Offsite copy
```

## Storage

### Local
Over the years, I had multiple Hard-Drives flying around, carrying duplicates of my data in case one of them breaks. Recently, I have been integrating my data into a [[nas]]-Setup.

#### Hierarchy

Where possible, I try to apply the same conventions to my filesystem, so I can navigate more efficiently and know where to find things.

backup-disk/
├── books/
├── documents/
├── games/
├── photos/
├── movies/
└── videos/

### Cloud
- [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/)
- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/)
- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
- [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/)
- [Mega](https://mega.nz/)

I use many of these services to diversify the locations of my data. This way, one provider can go down, but there will likely still be another one available.
