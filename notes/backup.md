# Backup
I don't worry much about losing files, because most of my data is stored in multiple cloud services, as well as on local hard drives.

Nevertheless, I plan on implementing a NAS backup system in the future.

The **3-2-1** strategy:
```
3 Copies of all my data
2 Copies on different storage media (e.g. HDD, SSD, Cloud)
1 Offsite copy
```

## Storage

### Local
Currently I have multiple Hard-Drives flying around, carrying duplicates of my data in case one of them breaks. In the long term I plan on implementing a [[nas]].

#### Hierarchy

backup-disk/
├── books/
│   ├── bootstrap.css
│   └── bootstrap-theme.min.css
├── games/
├── photos/
├── movies/
└── videos/

### Cloud
- [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/)
- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/)
- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
- [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/)
- [Mega](https://mega.nz/)

I use all of these services to diversify the locations of my data. This way, one provider can go down, but there will likely still be another one available.
