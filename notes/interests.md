These are some of my main areas of interest:

- [music](#music)
- [entertainment](#entertainment)
- [food]()

## tech
### mobile devices
My main interaction with technology is done via handheld or portable devices. They are my tool and interface to create things in the digital realm. 
Some important gadgets in my life:
- smartphone
- laptop
- smartwatch

I think a lot about how these devices are improving over time and for they can be used to enhance our lives

## [[dev]]
One way to participate in the improvement of technology is to continually develop new software. The user experience of applications is really important to me and I enjoy finding new ways to interact with technology (voice and gesture controls come to mind)

### openness 
Sharing knowledge and making information freely available is important to me, which is what got me started in creating my [[zettelkasten]]. Many of the things I learn or think about are openly accessible and I encourage others to share their creations online as open source projects. 

### making
Aside from software, I occasionally do some tinkering with hardware, such as microcontrollers, with my own [[3DPrinting]] setup and workshop. Recently, I also joined a maker space in my area, the [Offene Werkstatt Mainz](https://offenewerkstattmainz.de/)

### [[smarthome]]
Another hobby of mine is to automate my life using [[homeassistant]] and various IoT-Devices. I have been migrating from mainly WiFi-connected devices to using ZigBee and (hopefully soon) Matter. I also run a [[homelab]] on a [[raspberrypi]] 5. 

## [[music]]

Much of my time is spent listening to music, mainly (German) hip hop and indie/pop. 
I create a playlist for every season of the year, which can be seen on my [Spotify profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/dennismuensterer).

## entertainment 

I watch a lot of movies and series on various streaming channels and services (as seen on my [[subscriptions]]). Comedy and Sci-Fi are my preferred genres and Iâ€™m not much of a horror fan. 

## [[food]]

Pizza and Sushi are my go-to favorite foods. Trying to eat more healthy stuff, but I do like my fast food from time to time
