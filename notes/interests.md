# Interests

These are some of my main areas of interest:

- [Technology](#tech)
- [Music](#music)
- [Entertainment](#entertainment)
- [Food](#food)

## Tech

I generally enjoy things that are [[modular]] and compatible with as many other things as possible.

As a fan of crowdfunding, I have backed over 100 projects on [[kickstarter]].

### Devices

My main interaction with technology is done via handheld or portable devices. They are my tool and interface to create things in the digital realm. 

Some important gadgets in my life:
- smartphone
- laptop
- smartwatch

I think a lot about how these devices are improving over time and how they can be used to enhance our lives.

## [[dev]]

One way for me to participate in the improvement of technology is to continually develop new software. The user experience of applications is really important to me and I enjoy finding new ways to interact with technology (voice and gesture controls come to mind)

### Open-Source

Sharing knowledge and making information freely available is important to me, which is what got me started in creating my [[zettelkasten]]. Many of the things I learn or think about are openly accessible and I encourage others to share their creations online as open source projects. 

### Making

Aside from software, I occasionally do some tinkering with hardware, such as microcontrollers, with my own [[3DPrinting]] setup and workshop. Recently, I also joined a maker space in my area, the [Offene Werkstatt Mainz](https://offenewerkstattmainz.de/)

### [[smarthome]]

Another hobby of mine is to automate my life using [[homeassistant]] and various IoT-Devices. I have been migrating from mainly WiFi-connected devices to using ZigBee and (hopefully soon) Matter. I also run a [[homelab]] on a [[raspberrypi]] 5. 

## [[music]]

Much of my time is spent listening to music, mainly (German) hip hop and indie/pop. 
I create a playlist for every season of the year, which can be seen on my [Spotify profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/dennismuensterer).

When I feel like it, I play the piano. (usually just with chords from the [Ultimate Guitar](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/) app or my own [[progressions]] app)

## Entertainment 

I watch a lot of [[movies]] and series on various streaming channels and services (as seen on my [[subscriptions]]). Comedy and Sci-Fi are my preferred genres and I‚Äôm not much of a horror fan. 

## [[food]]

Pizza, Pasta and Sushi are my go-to favorite foods. Trying to eat more healthy stuff, but I do like my fast food from time to time...
