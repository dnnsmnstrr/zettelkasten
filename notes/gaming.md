# Gaming

My [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/dnnsmnstrr) library is full of games, mainly because I buy a lot of [Humble Bundles](https://humblebundle.com/). I've made some of my duplicate keys available at https://muensterer.tech/humblekeys/. Feel free to redeem a key if there are some unused ones, but please leave some for others. üôè

## Favorites
Some of my favorite games:
- Fallout 4
- Portal & Portal 2
- Life is Strange
- ASTRONEER
- Kerbal Space Program
- Papers Please

## VR
For playing in virtual reality, I have the first generation Oculus Quest. Most of my games are on the device, but sometimes I connect it to my PC for Google Earth VR or to try a game that was cheaper to get on Steam.

IMO, the best games for VR are SUPERHOT and Beatsaber.
