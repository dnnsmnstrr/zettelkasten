# Gaming

My [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/dnnsmnstrr) library is full of games, mainly because I buy a lot of [Humble Bundles](https://humblebundle.com/). I've made some of my duplicate keys [freely available](https://dnnsmnstrr.github.io/humblekeys/). Check it out and snag some games, if there are some unused keys, but please leave some for others. üôè

## Favorites
Some of my favorite games:
- Fallout 4
- Portal & Portal 2
- Life is Strange
- ASTRONEER
- Kerbal Space Program
- Papers Please

## VR
For playing in virtual reality, I have the first generation Oculus Quest. Most of my games are on the device, but sometimes I connect it to my PC for Google Earth VR or to try a game that was cheaper to get on Steam.

IMO, the best games for VR are SUPERHOT and Beatsaber.

## Mobile
I mainly play games on my [Steam Deck](https://www.steamdeck.com/).

A selection of my favorite gaming apps:

- Threes
- Bloons TD 6
- Candy Crush (only in short phases)

## Humble Tips

Install [this](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/40412-steam-game-marker-humble-bundle) user script to show which games are in your steam library directly in HumbleBundle.
[This script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/425225-redeem-steam-key-auto-accept-terms) will quickly redeem steam keys.
