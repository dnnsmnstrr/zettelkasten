# Uptime

My [[website]] and services are monitored using [Upptime](https://upptime.js.org/).

It runs in [Github Actions](https://github.com/dnnsmnstrr/uptime) and is hosted on [Pages](https://dnnsmnstrr.github.io/uptime/).

The configuration is at https://github.com/dnnsmnstrr/uptime/blob/master/.upptimerc.yml
