# Hyperkey
Who needs caps lock anyway?

The [Hyperkey](https://medium.com/macoclock/solve-shortcut-hell-in-macos-building-a-hyper-key-1cb8838bf521) maps caps lock to a combination of all modifier key, enabling an additional layer of shortcuts. This is done using [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/).

My favorite use is to trigger <alfred> using `hyper + a`. This is way more convenient and allows triggering a <bettertouchtool> action at the same time.
