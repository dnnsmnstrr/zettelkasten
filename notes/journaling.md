# Journaling 

At the beginning of 2023, I decided to give journaling a try. I had used the Day One app for a bit before, but never got into it. 
Now my goal is to continue for at least for a year, writing down the events of every single day

## Requirements 
- For my goal to work, the journaling environment has to be mobile first
- Easy access is important - daily reminder, quick actions from home screen 
- Automations and metadata - add tags and as much metadata as possible, to make entries searchable, show locations on map etc. 

## Day One
I've had the app since before it switched to a [[subscription ]] based revenue-model. Therefore I don't have to pay continually to get the features I want (mainly iCloud backups and multi-device usage)

### Setup

#### Journals
- main journal for daily entries with "day summary" template 
```md
# Day Summary

Any notable things happen today?
- 

Highlight of the day?

I’ve been thinking about…

What’s next?
- [ ]
```
- Place journal to record places I previously visited, lived at or want to remember in some way
```md
# Title

What happened here?  

Who was I here with?
```


#### [[shortcuts]]
The shortcuts integration lets me put a link to create a daily summary directly on my home screen, which I only display in my sleep [[focus]].
