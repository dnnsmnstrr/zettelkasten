# Journaling

In the beginning of 2023, I decided to give journaling a try. I had used the Day One app for a bit before, but never got into it.
Now my goal is to continue for at least for a year, writing down the events of every single day

## Requirements
- For my goal to work, the journaling environment has to be mobile first
- Easy access is important - daily reminder, quick actions from home screen
- Automations and metadata - add tags and as much metadata as possible, to make entries searchable, show locations on map etc.


### Day One
I've had the app since before it switched to a [[subscriptions]]-based revenue-model. Therefore I don't have to pay continually to get the features I want (mainly iCloud backups and multi-device usage)
#### Setup
- main `journal` for daily entries with "day summary" template
- `Prompts` for answering daily prompts or other questions

```md
# Day Summary

Any notable things happen today?
-

Highlight of the day?

I’ve been thinking about…

```
- **Place** journal to document places I previously visited, lived at or want to remember in some way
```md
# Title

What happened here?

Who was I here with?
```


### iOS Journals app
After being a bit underwhelmed with iOS 17’s journaling app, I have decided to continue using Day One. After longer trips or special events, I might write down more detailed accounts in this app, depending on how good the suggestions work. 

### [[shortcuts]]

The shortcuts integration lets me put a link to create a daily summary directly on my home screen, which I only display in my sleep [[focus]].

I created [this shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/17494/) to quickly get and answer [40 questions](https://github.com/kepano/40-questions/) to ask yourself each year.

#### Gratitude Journaling

- Be specific about what made you happy (daily highlight)
