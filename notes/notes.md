# Notes

For quick notes in my day-to-day life I prefer using Apple Notes, as these are quickly available on all my devices and synchronize over iCloud.

Recently, I have started adopting the [Forever Notes](https://www.myforevernotes.com/). 
My favorite concepts of the system are the home note with links to hub notes, which in turn include backlinks to the home note. This allows for swift navigation between topics. I also keep a note for each of my projects, so I can quickly write down ideas when they come to my head. Active [[projects]] are linked in the home note too. For [[journaling]], I am still using Day One.
