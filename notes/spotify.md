# [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/dennismuensterer)

I listen to a lot of #[[music]]. That's why I make a new playlist every season [üå∏](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/68z163CKUImi0QB6ZpSigr?si=u5CbZui-SAuTb9udvsVK7A)[‚òÄÔ∏è](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5wpb3PdQOzFb3jurTcVfZO?si=3C2uBhR7Svm9PSTnapgSMA)[üçÇ](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/22XncHS02W5RWJ1yM4lV6l?si=x9BbzrhZSY-RSzYG0-4vIQ)[‚ùÑÔ∏è](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/67SvJfEofXhdIXwsuUJbCJ?si=9IJxvMugQnWxrDdG0TzCFg)

My playlists are also documented on a [Universe page](https://dnnsmnstrr.onuniverse.com/playlists) (there's a [[gif]] for every playlist)

The [current playlist](http://muensterer.link/playlist/current) I'm listening to is available via my [[api]].

I also created a [web-application](https://github.com/dnnsmnstrr/sortify) that lets you [sort playlist tracks](https://dnnsmnstrr.github.io/sortify) by the length of their name.
