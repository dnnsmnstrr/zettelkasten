# Decisions


## Methods

### Consultitative individual decision making
- asking for input from select individual to form the basis of a decision

1. assess the situation and evaluate obvious options/choices
2. go to 2-3 experts and get their opinions
3. decide based on the feedback you received

- + different perspectives and more technical knowledge can be included in the decision
- - might exclude certain people and make them feel unimportant

### Thumb of Evolution 👍 / 👎
- decide on a boolean question with thumbs up/down

- + quick, better for small decisions
- - does not allow for multiple alternatives

### Fist to Five ✊
- veto decisions with a fist
- rate decision from 1 to 5, with the highest rating being fully on board

- - + levels of consensus
- - requires discussion to reach final decision

### Systemic Consensus
- works for evaluating multiple options
- *systemic condensing* - identify the proposal with minimal amount of resistance in the group

1. Create a table to rank multiple options on a scale (1-5 or 0-10) with the highest value being the highest resistance score (opposite from fist to five)
2. Tally the total resistance points for each (the highest score could be seen as a veto)
3. Consider a **zero-option**, where no action is required

| Team Member | Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Alice       | 4        | 10       | 3        |
| Bob         | 6        | 8        | 2        |
| Dennis      | 2        | 4        | 5        |
| Total       | 12       | 22       | 10       |
-> Option 3 would win here, because it has the lowest total score
