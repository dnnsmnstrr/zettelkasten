# Raycast

A launch bar similar to [[alfred]]. I have begun porting some of my workflows to Raycast, as it offers more flexibility in the presentation of the [[ui]].

## Extensions

I created an extension for [[bettertouchtool]]. It lets you search for and run named trigger commands within Raycast

<a title="Install bettertouchtool Raycast Extension" href="https://www.raycast.com/dnnsmnstrr/bettertouchtool"><img src="https://www.raycast.com/dnnsmnstrr/bettertouchtool/install_button@2x.png?v=1.1" height="64" alt="" style="height: 64px;"></a>
