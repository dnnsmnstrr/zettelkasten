# [My website](https://dnnsmnstrr.github.io)

|[muensterer.whateverdomainwascheapest](https://https://dnnsmnstrr.github.io)|

Hosting on Github [[pages]] is free, but domains usually are not, so I tend to switch domains fairly regularly (whenever renewal would be too expensive).

Some domains I've had:
- muensterer.tech
- muensterer.xyz
- muensterer.link

I also made a personal [[api]], which provides data to some of my #[[projects]], as well as [[redirect]] service with dynamic aliases, so I don't have to remember any links.

Currently, I am working on an extension to the website using [kbar](https://github.com/timc1/kbar). This will enable an [[alfred]]-like interface directly within the page. Try it with <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd>

## DNS

Regardless of which Registrar I'm currently using, I try to keep the configuration and set up consistent and minimal. The `dennis.` subdomain directs to my [Universe Landing Page](https://dnnsmnstrr.onuniverse.com)

CNAME & Redirect setup:
| Host | Value |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| CNAME       | dnnsmnstrr.github.io       |
| dennis       | https://dnnsmnstrr.onuniverse.com      |
| api       | https://dnnsmnstrr.vercel.app/api/    |
| *       | https://dnnsmnstrr.vercel.app/api/redirect    |
