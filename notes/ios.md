# iOS

My main mobile operating system 

## Apps

I love Apps and download a lot of them (sometimes even make my own). Usually there are at least 200 apps on my phone.

### Must-Have

These Apps **have** to be on my phone for it to be usable to me.

- [[spotify]]
- Comms: WhatsApp, Telegram, Mattermost
- Socials: Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, ~~Reddit~~ (not since [Apollo was killed](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/s/5s1pPrgg8i))
- Amazon, Kickstarter (gotta keep consuming)
- Finance Stuff (Banking, Crypto)
  - Sparkasse
  - Revolut
  - Coinbase
- Dev
  - Working Copy (for [[git]] on the go)
  - GitHub
  - Scriptable, Data Jar, Shortcutify (dependencies for [[shortcuts]])
  - Obsidian for notes editing 

### Games

My go-to for killing some time is Threes.
I also enjoyed:

- Blackbox
- Candy Crush (I can stop anytime!)
- Smash Hit
- Bloons TD-6
... a more detailed list is in [[gaming]]

### Making Music

- Ultimate Guitar (Chords & Lyrics for songs)
- Audiobus
- Loopy
- GarageBand
- Flip
- AutoTune

## Configuration

### Home Screen 
- The first page of my home screen is mostly made up of siri-suggestion widgets, which display my most (recently) used apps
- Depending on the current focus, the next page will display relevant apps for that mode (work, travel, ...)
- The last page are folders organized by category:
   - Productivity
  - Storage
  - Utilities
  - Devices
  - Music
  - Shortcuts
  - Entertainment
  - Travel
  - Food
  - Finance
  - Shopping
  - Dev
  - Health
  - Smart Home
  - Organization
  - Games

### Focus modes

I have focuses set up for different situations:

- Default (at home, entertainment and gaming)
- Sleep (dark, minimal home screen)
- Work (apps related to my workplace, block distractions)
- Travel (quick access to travel related functions)
- Shopping (activates in certain stores and shows my shopping list/wallet)
- Coding (for [[shortcuts]] development)
- Piano (while making [[music]])
- Driving

Each of these modes has a related lock screen and watch face, which automatically activate when the focus is turned on.

### Control Center

4. Erase data and content
5. Wait for device to reset
6. Log in
