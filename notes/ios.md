# iOS
I recently upgraded from an iPhone 6s to the 13 mini. In doing so, I was able to try things that I've been waiting years to do:
- Automations using NFC Tags
- Tap Gestures (3 Taps for Flashlight is super useful)

## Apps
### Must-Have
These Apps **have** to be on my phone for it to be usable to me.

- [[spotify]]
- Comms: WhatsApp, Telegram, Mattermost
- Socials: Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Reddit (duh)
- Amazon, Kickstarter (gotta keep consuming)
- Finance Stuff (Banking, Crypto
    - Sparkasse
    - Revolut
    - Coinbase
- Dev
  - Working Copy (for [[git]] on the go)
  - GitHub
  - Scriptable, Data Jar, Shortcutify (dependencies for [[shortcuts]])

### Games
My go-to for killing some time is Threes.
I also enjoyed:

- Blackbox
- Candy Crush (I can stop anytime!)
- Smash Hit
... a more detailed list is in [[gaming]]

### Making Music

- Ultimate Guitar (Chords & Lyrics for songs)
- Audiobus
- Loopy
- GarageBand
- Flip
- AutoTune

## Configuration

## Focus modes

I have focuses set up for different situations:
- Default (at home, entertainment and gaming)
- Sleep (dark, minimal home screen)
- Work (apps related to my workplace, block distractions)
- Travel (quick access to travel related functions)
- Shopping (activates in certain stores and shows my shopping list/wallet)
- Coding (for [[shortcuts]] development)
- Piano (while making [[music]])
- Driving

Each of these modes has a related lock screen and watch face, which automatically activate when the focus is turned on.
### Control Center
