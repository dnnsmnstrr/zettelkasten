# iOS

The last upgrade of my [[stack]] was from an iPhone 6s to the 13 mini. In doing so, I was able to try things that I've been waiting years to do:
- Automations using NFC Tags
- Download all my liked songs on [[spotify]]
- Use FaceID

## Steps to reset the OS

1. Update list of important apps
2. Ensure all important data is stored to the cloud or backed up on separate device(s)
3. Unpair Apple Watch
4. Erase data and content
5. Wait for device to reset
6. Log in

- ## Configuration

## Focus modes

I have focuses set up for different situations:

- Default (at home, entertainment and gaming)
- Sleep (dark, minimal home screen)
- Work (apps related to my workplace, block distractions)
- Travel (quick access to travel related functions)
- Shopping (activates in certain stores and shows my shopping list/wallet)
- Coding (for [[shortcuts]] development)
- Piano (while making [[music]])
- Driving

Each of these modes has a related lock screen and watch face, which automatically activate when the focus is turned on.
