# iOS
I recently upgraded from an iPhone 6s to the 13 mini. In doing so, I was able to try things that I've been waiting years to do:
- Automations using NFC Tags
- Tap Gestures (3 Taps for Flashlight is super useful)

## Apps
### Must-Have
These Apps **have** to be on my phone for it to be usable to me.

- [[spotify]]
- Comms: WhatsApp, Telegram, Mattermost
- Socials: Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Reddit (duh)
- Amazon, Kickstarter (gotta keep consuming)
- Finance Stuff (Banking, Crypto)
- Dev
  - Working Copy (for [[git]] on the go)
  - GitHub
  - Scriptable, Data Jar, Shortcutify (dependencies for [[shortcuts]])

### Games
My go-to for killing some time is Threes.
I also enjoyed:

- Blackbox
- Candy Crush (I can stop anytime!)
- Smash Hit
... a more detailed list is in [[gaming]]

### Making Music

- Ultimate Guitar (Chords & Lyrics for songs)
- Audiobus
- Loopy
- GarageBand
- Flip
- AutoTune
