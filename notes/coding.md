# Coding

My preferred programming language is [[js]]

For code editing I use VSCode, in some cases Xcode - see [[ide]]

I have a [coding playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0camicGxGNwB9YS66nAwtb) on [[spotify]]. My aim is to keep it at 1337 songs, but sometimes there are more when I found a bunch of new songs. 

My first steps with programming were in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). At university I learned C, Java and Racket. The Apple Developer Academy taught me Swift and now I mainly use JavaScript, starting to learn TypeScript.
