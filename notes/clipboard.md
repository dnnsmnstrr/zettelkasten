# Clipboard 

The clipboard is one of the most important tools of a developer. Some things I have learned/routines I have started following:

- Never delete text that might become useful again, always cut instead (requires an active clipboard manager)
- Before submitting a form on a website, be sure to copy the contents in case it get lost

## Clipboard managers

It is a good idea to keep a history of your clipboard. In Windows this can be accessed by pressing <kbd>Windows</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>.
On macOS, I always have at least one clipboard management application running. [[alfred]], [[bettertouchtool]] and [[raycast]] all include such capabilities. There is also the mac/iOS app [PastePal](https://indiegoodies.com/PastePal), which I like for its [[shortcuts]] integration.
