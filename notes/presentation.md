# Presentation
I have held many presentations throughout my time in school, university and apprenticeship.

## Tools

- Keynote / Powerpoint (duh!)
- [Prezi](https://prezi.com/) - cloud-based presentation software
  - pretty happy with [this one about public communication networks](https://prezi.com/hypoef0d6u0d/)
- [Slides.com](https://slides.com) - html based presentations
  - a [list](https://slides.com/dennismuensterer/projects) of my [[projects]] as a presentation ([interactable](https://slides.com/dennismuensterer/projects#/2))
- [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/) - good for simple, collaborative presentations, often used this for Hackathons
  - [winning presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z9yq6mE4wxpUJ0PetD2jfbudkfOeCzNY0FiUoZzrT5s/edit?usp=sharing) at [Medienberghack 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvAfQJi7Gdk) (I also [pitched](https://youtu.be/bbRZyqyAvqY?t=3620) one of my [[ideas]] there)
