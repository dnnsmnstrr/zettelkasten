# [Dotfiles](https://github.com/dnnsmnstrr/dotfiles)

I keep my dotfiles in version control using [[git]] and [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).

They include setup scripts for easily getting a new dev environment running exactly the way I want it. Lots of the installation process is handled by [[brew]]

There are configuration files for various shells, with aliases to make navigating the [[cli]] more efficient or fun.

Some folders are submodules, such as my [[bettertouchtool]] preset, [HydroTouch](https://github.com/dnnsmnstrr/HydroTouch) or my [[alfred]] workflows.
