# Learning
I feel like I learn the most by actually doing stuff. This can be in my [[projects]] or at work, but university didn't really work for me. (as can be seen in my [life-timeline](http://muensterer.xyz/life/))

## [Challenge-Based-Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge-based_learning)
At the [Apple Developer Academy](https://www.developeracademy.unina.it/en/), we were taught using the [CBL](https://www.challengebasedlearning.org). This is a framework built up in steps:
1. Engage
    - Big Ideas
    - Essential Questioning
    - Challenges
1. Investigate
    - Guiding Questions
    - Guiding Activities
    - Synthesis
1. Act
    - Solution Concepts
    - Solution Development
    - Implementation & Evaluation

## Resources
