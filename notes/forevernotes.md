# [Forever Notes](https://myforevernotes.com/)

To organize my Apple Notes setup, I have implemented the Forever âœ± Notes system. 
My favorite concept is the pinned [home note](https://www.myforevernotes.com/docs/home) with links to [hubs](https://www.myforevernotes.com/docs/hubs) for specific topics. 

Other things I adopted from this system:
- [Collections](https://www.myforevernotes.com/docs/collections) for gathering tagged notes
