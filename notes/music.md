# Music
I love music. Check out my [[spotify]] playlists! A [selection](https://www.youtube.com/user/DennisMuensterer/playlists?view=50&flow=grid&shelf_id=1) has also been ported to [[youtube]]

## Instruments
My main instrument is the piano. ðŸŽ¹
I also play ukulele and collect various electronic instruments, such as Sample/Drum Pads, MIDI-Keyboards and my self-built [ThereMIDI](https://github.com/dnnsmnstrr/ThereMIDI).

## Chords
'Cause I'm lazy as fðŸ’¤k, I stopped learning sheet music at some point, when I realized most popular songs can be played by simply [knowing 4 letters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ). Thats why I mainly use [Ultimate-Guitar](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/u/dnnsmnstrr) to save lyrics and chords I want to play. When there are no chords available, I resort to [Genius](https://genius.com/) and play the music by ear. ðŸ‘‚
