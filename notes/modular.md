Modular things somehow tickle my brain in the right place.

This is a non-comprehensive list of things and systems in my [[life]] that have interconnected pieces:

- [[gridfinity]] - an organization system for [[3DPrinting]]
- IKEA [Skadis](https://www.ikea.com/de/de/p/skadis-lochplatte-kombination-s89406365/) & [Ivar](https://www.ikea.com/de/de/planners/ivar-planner/) - the pegboards fit perfectly into IKEA's classic modular furniture
- [GoPro-Mounting-System](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2194278) - IMO the best way to connect things together in a flexible way
- LEGO - modular by design, especially the technic pieces. I even had some success printing my own custom pieces using [this app](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2194278)
- Aluminum [Extrusion/Profiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-slot_structural_framing) - there is a reason most frames of 3D-Printers are made with these, I built a mini-server-rack with them
- [Multiboard](https://www.multiboard.io/) and [HSW](https://www.printables.com/model/152592-honeycomb-storage-wall) - better for vertical surface than Gridfinity and easier to print than Skadis
- [Euroboxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_container) - sturdy boxes conforming to industrial standards
- [Europallets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUR-pallet) - made a [bed](https://www.tiktok.com/@dennis.makerer/video/6914029186491485442) with these things and [PlayWood-Connectors](https://playwood.it/), which has since been transformed into a couch
- IKEA [ÅSKVÄDER](https://www.ikea.com/de/de/p/askvaeder-starter-set-4-tlg-weiss-50486711/) power outlet and cable system
- Rollingsquare [EDGE Pro](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rollingsquare/edge-pro-bring-true-modularity-to-your-workstation) - brings together my chargers, phone and laptop using [[magnets]]
