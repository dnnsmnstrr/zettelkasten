# Magnets

As a big fan of magnets, my collection of magnetic things is ever growing. 

I like being able to interconnect things and magnets are one of the easiest ways to make such connections possible. 

## Devices
The following devices and gadgets I own use magnets in some way:
- iPhone with MagSafe
- (Bluetooth) Speakers
- [EDGE Pro](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rollingsquare/edge-pro-bring-true-modularity-to-your-workstation)
- [Sandwich Wallet](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1039166851/puncube-sandwich-wallet-20-the-first-crossover-wallet)
- [Stikey](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/17821891/stikey-a-magnetic-portable-stand-and-cable-tidy-on)
- [Dundabunga](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bungajungle/dundabunga-mobile-freedom) and other devices from bungajungle like the [Neutron](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bungajungle/mount-anything-anywhere-neutron-a-and-neutron-s)

A big reason why I like the [[gridfinity]] system is its use of magnets, which has the benefit of being able to place gridfinity bins on magnetic surfaces and having them stick.
