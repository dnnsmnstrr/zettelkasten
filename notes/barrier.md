# Barrier
My desk setup includes two stationary monitors and one MacBook. The monitors are connected to my desktop pc running Windows.
In order to use the MacBook's keyboard and mouse/trackpad on my pc, I have set up barrier as my solution.

## Config

- Swap `Super` and `Ctrl` keys in mac server to use command key for copy-pasting etc...

## Alternatives

[Synergy]()
- paid, with essentially the same features

[ShareMouse]()
- sharing works in both directions at the same time
- free version only works with one monitor per device
