# Barrier
My desk setup includes two stationary monitors and a MacBook Pro. The monitors are connected to my desktop pc running Windows.
In order to use the MacBook's keyboard and mouse/trackpad on my pc, I have set up [Barrier](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier) as my kvm solution.

## Config

- Swap `Super` and `Ctrl` keys in mac server to use <kbd>command</kbd> key for copy-pasting etc...

## Alternatives

[Synergy](https://symless.com/synergy)
- paid, with essentially the same features

[ShareMouse](https://www.sharemouse.com/de/)
- sharing works in both directions at the same time
- free version only works with one monitor per device
