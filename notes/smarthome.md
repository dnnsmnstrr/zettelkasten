# Smarthome

My local setup runs on a Home Assistant Yellow with a Raspberry Pi CM4. I also use Phillips Hue lights as well as a few other compatible lighting/ smart socket devices. Another company I rely on is SwitchBot for Button automations and the S10 cleaning robot. 

Most of my devices can also be controlled via Amazon Alexa.
