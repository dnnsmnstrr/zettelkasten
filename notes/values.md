# Values

These are my main values or core beliefs that form the basis of my thinking and how I find my position in an argument. I tend to end up in the middle, between extreme sides, as I try to consider all viewpoints and often see valid opinions on both ends of a discussion. 

Obviously, there are some things that are non-negotiable:

1. Personal Freedom - everyone should be able to decide what is right for themselves, as long as it does not affect or harm someone else
2. Personal Opinion - everyone is allowed to have their own opinion on a topic, but must be aware that this opinion might not be accepted by someone else
3. Common Sense - many discussions can become emotional, so it is important to keep the facts in mind and to consider arguments rationally

>When there is no common ground for the facts, it will be difficult to lead a purposeful discussion

## Tenets

- **Open-Mindedness**
	- Embrace diverse perspectives
	- Understand different viewpoints before forming an opinion
- **Transparency**
	- Important information should be made freely available in its true form
- **Empower Ideas**
	- Good ideas should be surfaced and considered
- **Acknowledge Bias**
	- Question opinions and how they were formed to identify flaws in the foundation
- **Adaptability**
	- Be willing to adjust your stance when new information or compelling arguments emerge

### Critical Thinking

Analyze information and arguments critically, assessing the credibility of sources and the strength of the evidence. 

- Distinguish between *[facts* and *opinions*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sav2L2E38XA)

| Opinion               | Fact                       |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| I think …             | I know … to be true        |
| I believe …           | I read/saw … (cite source) |
| In my opinion, …      | According to …             |
| From my point of view | Can we agree that … ?      |

### Other important stuff

- technology should create progress and must be developed in a way that helps humans
	- open-source is a good way to ensure this
- existing information should be preserved and made publicly available where possible
	- projects like [Wikipedia](https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?uselang=en) or the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/donate?origin=iawww-TopNavDonateButton) must be supported to enable this
- a peaceful resolution to conflicts should always be the goal
