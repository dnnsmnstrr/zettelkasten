# Gridfinity

As a fan of modular things, Zack Freedmanâ€™s storage system really caught my attention. I have printed countless custom storage bins, holders and baseplates to organize my stuff.

It is always going to be a work in progress, but I really like how flexible the system is and continue to find new ways to organize my life in a grid.

### Baseplates
My go-to baseplate is the [Screw-Together](https://www.printables.com/model/300603-gridfinity-screw-together-baseplate) version with 3 scew holes
