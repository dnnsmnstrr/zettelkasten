As a fan of modular things, Zack Freedmanâ€™s storage system really caught my attention. I have printed countless custom storage bins, holders and baseplates to organize my stuff.

It is always going to be a work in progress, but I really like how flexible the system is and continue to find new ways to organize my life in a grid.
