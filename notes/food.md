# Food

I used to really like eating meat, but that has dwindled over the years, since more and more alternative products have become available. I'm not a vegetarian, but I try to eat less meat (especially when cooking with others).

When eating alone, I usually don't eat the most healthy foods. My go-to is the frozen "Ja!"-Lasagna, which is just disgusting, but I enjoy it for some reason.

Things I'm good at making myself:
- Pizza & Flammkuchen
- Sushi
- Noodles (from scratch)

That's about it. I'm not a great cook. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
