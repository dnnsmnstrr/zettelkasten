This mouse by Logitech has really cool features. The magnetic scroll wheel is amazing and the side buttons and  vertical scroll wheel are great.

## [Logi Options+](https://www.logitech.com/software/logi-options-plus.html)

Unfortunately, the software for this mouse really sucks.

I've had multiple issues with it, which have mostly been solved by [removing all Logitech software](https://www.reddit.com/r/logitech/comments/qnl1y6/logi_options_backend_connection_problem/) and installing the latest version of Logi Options+.

Aside from their cloud backups, there is no way to create a backup file, so here are my most important configurations for reference:

### [[chrome]]

In Chrome, I like to be able to close tabs by clicking the shift wheel mode button.
The horizontal scroll wheel is used to scroll through tabs.

### [[spotify]]

- Activate media controls for gestures
- Horizontal scroll wheel for volume
- Shift button for next track

### [[atom]]

- Shift button toggles terminal (<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd>)

### [[jitsi]]

- Forward/backward for mute/unmute and toggling video
- Gestures assigned to various shortcuts (`C` for chat, `P` for participants, `T` for stats)
