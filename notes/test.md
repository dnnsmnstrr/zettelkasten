This is a test note. It was created to see if my [[alfred]]-[[zettelkasten]] workflow works as expected.

## Mermaid

Here I am testing [mermaid]() support

```{.mermaid}
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    activate John
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    deactivate John
```

## Working copy
