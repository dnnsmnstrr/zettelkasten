# Shell

## Aliases & Functions
My [[dotfiles]] include various shell [aliases](https://github.com/dnnsmnstrr/dotfiles/tree/master/shell/aliases) and [functions](https://github.com/dnnsmnstrr/dotfiles/tree/master/shell/functions). Some are available in ZSH and bash, being shared in [`profile`](https://github.com/dnnsmnstrr/dotfiles/tree/master/shell/profile)
They can be searched from [[alfred]] using [alfred-bash-profile-commands](https://www.packal.org/workflow/bash-profile-commands)

## [[cli]]] [argument default value](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2013547/assigning-default-values-to-shell-variables-with-a-single-command-in-bash)
```bash
VARIABLE=${1:-$DEFAULTVALUE}
```
