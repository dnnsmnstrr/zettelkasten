## Camping Checklist
What to remember for the camping part:
- Prepare for every type of weather (warm, wet, cold)
	- Bring watertight shoes or crocs
	- A rain poncho is a must
- Make sure your tent is waterproofed before leaving to the festival area
- Have enough dry clothes (especially socks) in a place that **will not** get wet
- Ear plugs are a good idea in case things get too loud
