# Projects

By working on random, seemingly useless projects, I apply the [Project-Based](https://dnnsmnstrr.github.io/projects)-[[learning]] methodology.
Regardless of how pointless these [[ideas]] might seem, there is always something to learn while executing a project.
For instance, my personal [[api]] or [[spotify]] [playlist-sorting-app](https://muensterer.xyz/sortify) may very well be unnecessary, but I undoubtedly learned some valuable lessons while working on them, such as [[pages]] deployment, documentation or authenticating with third-party APIs.

My main projects, which are under continuous development include:
- [[website]]
- [[dotfiles]]
- [[zettelkasten]]

This gist includes some other projects
