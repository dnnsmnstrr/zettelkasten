## What I’m doing now 

> Last updated: 2023-11-04


Living in: Mainz, Germany

Working at: [hpm GmbH](https://web.hpm.agency) 

Current [theme](https://www.themesystem.com/) : `Year of the docs`

In the beginning of 2023, I began [[journaling]] with Day One. My goal is to make one entry a day for at least one entire year. 
I was excited for [Apple’s own journaling app](https://9to5mac.com/2023/04/21/apple-journaling-app/), but after finally getting it in iOS 17.2, I’m quite disappointed. Will be sticking with Day One for a while. 
#### [[music]]
Current Playlist: [Regen](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2uL3x2SDjeumqANdztCI4A)

#### [[gaming]] 
- [Recently played on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/dnnsmnstrr/games/?tab=recent)
- back in a candy crush phase at the moment

#### Reading
Still reading: "Hass" by [Şeyda Kurt](https://seydakurt.de/buecher/)

#### [[projects]]

While playing piano, I got frustrated by the Ultimate Guitar Tabs app, so I built my own chords app with Expo and React Native. Right now I’m in the process of porting the application to SwiftUI 

I'm also moving my [[redirect]] API to a separate project with built-in AI capabilities: [redairect.com](https://redairect.com)

#### Activities
- joined the https://offenewerkstattmainz.de/ - a Makerspace that was opened close to what I live
- participating in the [Circular Hackfest](https://hackfest.tech/) soon
