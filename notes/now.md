## What I’m doing now 

> Last updated: 2023-07-11


Living in: Mainz, Germany

Working at: [hpm GmbH](https://web.hpm.agency) 

Current [theme](https://www.themesystem.com/) : `Year of the docs`

In the beginning of 2023, I began [[journaling]] with Day One. My goal is to make one entry a day for at least one entire year. 
I heard Apple will be [making their own journaling app](https://9to5mac.com/2023/04/21/apple-journaling-app/), which I'm excited for. (Can't wait to try iOS 17)

#### [[music]]
Current Playlist: [Take It Off](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3T8e2O5sYOVqSERJnmTqvL)

#### [[gaming]] 
- [Recently played on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/dnnsmnstrr/games/?tab=recent)
- Got into Bloons TD 6

#### Reading
Currently reading: "Hass" by [Şeyda Kurt](https://seydakurt.de/buecher/)

#### [[projects]]

While playing piano, I got frustrated by the Ultimate Guitar Tabs app, so I'm building my own chords app with Expo and React Native. 

I'm also trying to port my [[redirect]] API to a separate project with built-in AI capabilities: [redairect.com](https://redairect.com)

#### Activities
- Going to the Oben Ohne Open Air festival in Munich soon
- Purchased a season ticket for the [Belantis](https://www.belantis.de/) theme park near Leipzig
