## What I’m doing now 

> Last updated: 2024-09-01

Living in: Mainz, Germany, soon I'll be in Munich for a while

Current [theme](https://www.themesystem.com/) : `Year of release`

My theme of the year turned out to be quite prophetic. I was released from my job due to the company going bankrupt, so I will be participating in batch #22 of the [Digital Product School](https://www.digitalproductschool.io/) in Munich for the next three months.
#### [[music]]
Current Playlist: [Pools and Palm Trees](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7fKN8cSY9vaqQU3yEErWHk?si=ce33f6cfaa444aa7)

#### [[gaming]] 
- [My recently played games on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/dnnsmnstrr/games/?tab=recent)
- Want to play through Uncharted 4 next

#### Reading
Still reading: "Hass" by [Şeyda Kurt](https://seydakurt.de/buecher/)
Also trying to finish „Limit“ by Frank Schätzing (getting closer to the end)
#### [[projects]]

While playing piano, I got frustrated by the Ultimate Guitar Tabs app, so I built my own chords app with Expo and React Native. I'm now on the third revision, back to using React Native after an attempt with SwiftUI. Hope to release the project on the App Store as soon as I get iCloud syncing to work consistently.

I'm also developing the idea of an app to create and manage organizational systems for physical items. Working title: **OrgSys**
#### Activities
- joined the [OW Mainz](https://offenewerkstattmainz.de/) - a maker space near where I live. It has recently expanded to a new building
