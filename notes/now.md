## What Iâ€™m doing now 

> [muensterer.tech/now](https://muensterer.tech/now)

I keep my now page content in a GitHub [[gist]] in JSON format: https://gist.github.com/dnnsmnstrr/f18bfa6e4f02dc480426d05cf7adff79

## Editor

I built a web-editor for my now data with [[expo]]. It is hosted at [now.expo.app](https://now.expo.app/).
A basic GitHub token with Gist permissions is required.
