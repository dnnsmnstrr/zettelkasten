## What I’m doing now 

> Last updated: 2024-09-25

Living in: Munich

Having joined the [Digital Product School](https://www.digitalproductschool.io/), I will be working on a project for the stakeholder [Würth](https://www.wuerth.de/) until the end of November.

Current [theme](https://www.themesystem.com/) : `Year of release`
#### [[music]]
Current Playlist: [Wien / München / Köln / Leipzig](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2BamYUcYazuRqudq38MX8Q?si=494f27b638ac4dad) - named after places I visited this year

#### [[gaming]] 
- [My recently played games on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/dnnsmnstrr/games/?tab=recent)
- Want to play through Uncharted 4 next

#### Reading
Still reading: "Hass" by [Şeyda Kurt](https://seydakurt.de/buecher/)
Also trying to finish „Limit“ by Frank Schätzing (getting closer to the end)

Received [The Mom Test](https://www.amazon.com/The-Mom-Test-Rob-Fitzpatrick-audiobook/dp/B07RJZKZ7F) at DPS and read that in a day ✅
#### [[projects]]

While playing piano, I got frustrated by the Ultimate Guitar Tabs app, so I built my own chords app with Expo and React Native. I'm now on the third revision, back to using React Native after an attempt with SwiftUI. Hope to release the project on the App Store as soon as I get iCloud syncing to work consistently.

I'm also developing the idea of an app to create and manage organizational systems for physical items. Working title: **OrgSys**

Other products I started building while at DPS:
- [Systemic Consensus](https//:consensus.muensterer.tech) - app to make decisions in a team
- [Oblique Strategies](https://oblique.muensterer.tech) - page to get random oblique strategies

#### Activities
- planning to visit Nuremberg in October
