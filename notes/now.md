In the beginning of 2023, I began [[journaling]] with Day One. My goal is to make one entry a day for at least one entire year. 
I heard Apple might be [making their own journaling app](https://9to5mac.com/2023/04/21/apple-journaling-app/), which I'm excited for. 

Recently went on a bike trip around the Bodensee with my family. 

Plan on going to the Stadt Ohne Meer and Oben Ohne Open Air festivals this summer. 

I can't wait for the [Deutschlandticket](https://www.bahn.de/angebot/regio/deutschland-ticket) to launch, it will allow me to travel through Germany more.
