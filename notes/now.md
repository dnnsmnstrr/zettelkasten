## What I’m doing now

Current playlist: [Warten](https://muensterer.tech/playlists/current)
Current [theme](https://www.themesystem.com/) : `Year of contact`

#### [[projects]]

Continually updating my [[website]] with new pages. I added [playlists](https://muensterer.tech/playlists) and a [uses](https://muensterer.tech/uses) page. Planning to add more [slashpages](https://slashpages.net/).

While playing piano, I got frustrated by the Ultimate Guitar Tabs app, so I built my own chords app with Expo and React Native. I'm now on the third revision, back to using React Native after an attempt with SwiftUI. Hope to release the project on the App Store as soon as I get iCloud syncing to work consistently.

I'm also developing the idea of an app to create and manage organizational systems for physical items. Working title: **OrgSys**

#### Activities
- Just saw the RTO and Jan Böhmermann in Cologne
