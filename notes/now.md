#### [[projects]]

While playing piano, I got frustrated by the Ultimate Guitar Tabs app, so I built my own chords app with Expo and React Native. Right now I’m in the process of porting the application to SwiftUI 

I'm also moving my [[redirect]] API to a separate project with built-in AI capabilities: [redairect.com](https://redairect.com)
