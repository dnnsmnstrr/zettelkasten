#### [[projects]]

In the beginning of 2023, I began [[journaling]] with Day One. My goal is to make one entry a day for at least one entire year. 
I heard Apple might be [making their own journaling app](https://9to5mac.com/2023/04/21/apple-journaling-app/), which I'm excited for. 

While playing piano, I got frustrated by the Ultimate Guitar Tabs app, so I'm building my own chords app with Expo and React Native. 

I'm also trying to port my [[redirect]] api to a separate project with built in AI capabilities: [redairect.com](https://redairect.com)

#### Activities
Going to the Stadt Ohne Meer and Oben Ohne Open Air festivals this summer.
