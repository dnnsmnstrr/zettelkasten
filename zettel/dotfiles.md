# [Dotfiles](https://github.com/dnnsmnstrr/dotfiles)

I keep my dotfiles in version control using <git>.
They include setup scripts for easily getting a new dev environment running exactly the way I want it. There are configuration files for various shells, with aliases to make navigating the <cli> more efficient or fun.
There is also my <bettertouchtool> preset, [HydroTouch](https://github.com/dnnsmnstrr/HydroTouch).
