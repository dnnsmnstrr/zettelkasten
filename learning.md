# Learning
I feel like I learn the most by actually doing stuff. This can be in my [[projects]] or at work, but university didn't really work for me. (as can be seen in my [life-timeline](http://muensterer.xyz/life/))

## Resources
A lot of this is inspired by  [@nikitavoloboev's]() [wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz)
